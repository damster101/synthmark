# SynthMark Privacy Policy

SynthMark is an app for measuring the CPU performance of an Android device.

It does not collect or store any user information.

## Test Results

The user can ask SynthMark to run automated tests that measure CPU performance.
These generate reports that contain the results of the test plus information about the phone including:

* manufacturer (eg. Samsung)
* model (eg. S10)
* version and build information (eg. Pie 9.0)
* audio performance metrics (eg. latency, glitch rate)
* audio feature support (eg. AAudio MMAP)

SynthMark will not transmit any of those reports by itself.

But you, the user, can can email them to someone, or upload them to Google Drive, or send them to other Sharing destinations.
This is optional. No reports are uploaded or saved by the program unless the user requests it.

The source code for SynthMark is available [here](https://github.com/google/synthmark) on GitHub.
